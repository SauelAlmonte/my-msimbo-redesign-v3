6. I began analyzing each team memebrs work I began to see how they created tehir sections
7. After analyzing I began fixing the issues that previously happened on Demo Day, so everything would work in perfect harmony, as best as I could
8. I attempted to incorporate Java Script but I am still trying my best to catch up, but also understand it.
9. I have deployed the finished project to Vercel, any question?
